Comments don't work in JSON! So here is a text file instead.

For object1.json:
Code an object which has keys storing values of simple data types:
Ex: string, number, boolean

For object2.json:
Code an object which has keys storing values of multiple data types:
Ex: string, number, boolean, array, object

For array.json:
Code an array of objects which each have the same key/value pair structure
