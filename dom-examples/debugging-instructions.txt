index3.html and script3.js have errors!

Use your investigative skills to track them down.

1. Why is the stylesheet not being applied, and we see only the styles that are being added by JavaScript later? 
    - Check the JS console in the browser - definitely an error, but not obvious what it is
    - Use common sense to check the import in the HTML file... there it is! A simple typo.

2. Why are the authors' names undefined in the <option> elements in the dropdown field?
    - Nothing in the JS console...
    - You might be able to figure it out just looking at the file in VSCode
    - If not, Adding a debugger in a strategic spot will help you slow down and examine the data in the Sources pane of the browser DevTools
    - Aha! It's a reference issue.

3. Why, if you use the dropdown field to switch to a different speech, are you getting word salad?
    - Nothing wrong with the data in speeches.js
    - Nothing wrong with the references, since the MLK speech that loads first is rendering properly
    - Maybe this has to do with the recursion of PrintNextChar()
    - Adding a console.log() shows that the characters are being sent in the right order
    - Time for some debugging in the browser DevTools!
